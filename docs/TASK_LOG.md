# Task Log

## 2026-07-01: Planning System Initialization

### Status

In progress.

### Summary

Created the initial planning package for PakimonGO before implementation. Captured the purified product prompt, discovery notes, requirements, SRS, architecture direction, process rules, roadmap, repo structure, knowledge system, QA strategy, security/privacy plan, data model plan, scoring/economy plan, Agile backlog, risk/debt registers, and OKF-style knowledge summaries.

### Decisions Made

- Plan before coding.
- Use a strict phase order: Discovery, Requirements, Agile SRS, Architecture, Prototypes, Scaffold, Implementation.
- Treat Flutter as the proposed mobile platform pending prototype validation.
- Treat PostgreSQL/PostGIS/pgvector plus object storage as the proposed data direction.
- Treat Firebase Auth/App Check/Storage as useful platform services, not the only canonical database.
- Treat scoring as server-authoritative and evidence-based.
- Treat public map locations as privacy-safe aggregates, not exact pins.
- Treat UGC moderation as launch-blocking.

### Open Work

- Review and approve SRS direction.
- Create remaining ADRs.
- Validate map provider options with prototype/cost/legal review.
- Backend framework is now accepted as FastAPI-style modular monolith for Sprint 0.
- Define scoring point ranges.
- Define first gold datasets.

### Next Exact Action

Review all planning docs for consistency, then create ADRs for auth, maps, AI scoring, storage, privacy, and moderation.

## 2026-07-01: Expanded Blueprint And Scaffold

### Status

In progress.

### Summary

Promoted the expanded PakimonGO blueprint into repository docs, repaired Git metadata, created the scaffold-only monorepo structure, added a short-burst commit policy, and added a conversation archive area for future full chat exports and AI handoff summaries.

### Decisions Made

- Treat the expanded 196-functional-requirement catalogue as the active requirements baseline.
- Treat gated Alpha-0 as the active SRS posture.
- Preserve empty scaffold folders with `.gitkeep`.
- Require short-burst semantic commits with AI attribution trailers.
- Require conversation archive updates when prompts or responses change direction, requirements, architecture, risk, process, or implementation state.

### Open Work

- Review and accept/revise proposed ADRs.
- Begin first Alpha-0 vertical slice work package.
- Scaffold runnable Flutter/FastAPI toolchains after ADR readiness.
- Paste full visible conversation into the prepared raw archive file if desired.

### Next Exact Action

Review ADR-001 through ADR-016, then decide whether WP-015 starts with Flutter/FastAPI toolchain scaffold or OpenAPI/contracts.

## 2026-07-01: Methodology-Aligned Pre-Code Specification

## 2026-07-01: Safeguard System + Sprint 0 Verification

### Status

Complete.

### Summary

Built the mandatory pre/post-task prompt loop system to prevent context drift, state doc neglect, traceability gaps, and file size violations. Added `tools/qa/pre_task_check.py`, `docs/SESSION_CHECKLIST.md`, and the embedded loop checklist in `AGENTS.md`. Verified all 5 completed Sprint 0 tasks (S0-001 through S0-005) by running tests, analysis, and validation. Fixed `SPRINT_0_PLAN.md` state drift where it still said "Planned. Not started" despite 5 tasks being done. All validation scripts pass.

### Artifacts Added

- `tools/qa/pre_task_check.py` — automated pre-task guard (checks state docs, sprint status, file sizes, traceability)
- `docs/SESSION_CHECKLIST.md` — running session audit log for accountability

### Artifacts Updated

- `AGENTS.md` — added MANDATORY TASK LOOP block with 9-step pre/post checklist
- `docs/sprints/SPRINT_0_PLAN.md` — status, backlog table, and commit sequence now reflect completed tasks

### Decisions Made

- The mandatory loop (pre_task_check → read state → read packet → trace check → work → validate → update docs → commit → update session log) is now required for every work burst.
- Verification loop: after every task, re-run pre_task_check.py + all 3 validation scripts before moving to next task.

### Next Exact Action

Start S0-007: score state model. Read `docs/qa/SCORING_STATE_TEST_SPEC.md` and `docs/TRACEABILITY_MATRIX.md` for FR-SCORE-001–004, FR-SCORE-010–011.

## 2026-07-01: S0-006 Public DTO Privacy Tests

### Status

Complete.

### Summary

Implemented the first real Sprint 0 tests — 7 privacy contract tests that validate public DTOs never expose exact coordinates, original media URLs, or EXIF/GPS metadata. Added `services/api/tests/test_privacy_dto.py` with tests against both `docs/qa/fixtures/` and `docs/api/examples/` JSON files.

### Tests Added (7 total)

- TC-PRIV-DTO-001: public submission response rejects exact coordinate fields
- TC-PRIV-DTO-002: public map activity uses cells/clusters, not pins
- TC-PRIV-DTO-003: public media DTO exposes derivative URL only
- TC-PRIV-DTO-004: public derivatives never include EXIF/GPS fields
- Negative test: bad_public_location_leak_example.json triggers detection (proves the test works)
- All public fixtures pass with zero forbidden fields
- Private fixtures allow exact coordinates (informational check)

### Artifacts Added

- `services/api/tests/test_privacy_dto.py` — 7 privacy contract tests

### Forbidden Fields Detected

latitude, longitude, lat, lng, gps_* prefix, exif_* prefix, originalUrl, storagePath, signedUrl, deviceId, ipAddress, moderationEvidence, sensitiveSpeciesExactLocation, etc.

### Validation

All 9 API tests pass (7 privacy + 2 health). All 4 validation scripts pass. pre_task_check.py PASS.

### Next Exact Action

S0-007: Score state model in packages/scoring/. Read SCORING_STATE_TEST_SPEC.md and traceability matrix first.

## 2026-07-01: S0-007 Score State Model

### Status

Complete.

### Summary

Implemented the score state machine as a standalone `packages/scoring-rules/` package. The model defines 8 states, 14 valid transitions, an immutable ScoreEvent dataclass with pre/post-init validation, explanation category enforcement, and server-authority guards. No scoring formula, point values, or AI provider calls are included per S0-007's forbidden boundary.

### Artifacts Added

- `packages/scoring-rules/src/__init__.py`
- `packages/scoring-rules/src/score_state.py` — ScoreState enum, transition table, ScoreEvent dataclass with validation
- `packages/scoring-rules/tests/test_score_state.py` — 18 tests
- `services/api/tests/test_score_state.py` — 17 tests (mirror, importable from API test suite)

### States

pending, prechecked, ai_evaluated, scored, capped, review, rejected, rolled_back

### Test Coverage (18 total)

- TC-SCORE-STATE-001: valid transition table (14 edges)
- TC-SCORE-STATE-002: invalid direct finalization blocked
- TC-SCORE-STATE-003: formula version required for final states
- TC-SCORE-STATE-004: append-only (immutable creation)
- TC-SCORE-STATE-005: zoo cap saves entry with participation ledger
- TC-SCORE-STATE-006: duplicate cap without deletion
- TC-SCORE-STATE-007: unsafe interaction routes to review/rejection
- TC-SCORE-STATE-008: rollback from scored/capped valid
- Property tests: all states have inbound paths (except pending), terminals are immutable, client authority limited to pending, explanation categories enforced, server cannot send client-initiated final states

### Validation

All 26 API tests pass (17 score + 9 existing). All 18 package tests pass. All 4 validation scripts pass. pre_task_check.py reports 6→7 completed Sprint 0 tasks.

### Next Exact Action

## 2026-07-01: S0-008 Capture Draft Model Shell

### Status

Complete.

### Summary

Implemented the capture draft model in Flutter inside `apps/mobile/pakimon_go_app/`. The model represents local draft metadata — no camera plugin, upload, or scoring logic. Designed to satisfy FR-CAP-001, FR-CAP-003, FR-CAP-004, FR-CAP-019.

### Artifacts Added

- `apps/mobile/pakimon_go_app/lib/features/capture/domain/capture_draft.dart`

  - `DraftLifecycle` enum: creating, saved, restored, deleted
  - `CaptureContext` enum: wild, zoo, pet, unknown
  - `CaptureDraftService` in-memory store: create, save, restore, delete
  - JSON serialization (`toJson`/`fromJson` round-trip)
- `apps/mobile/pakimon_go_app/test/features/capture/capture_draft_test.dart` — 13 unit tests

### Test Coverage (13 Flutter tests)

- Create with required fields
- markSaved lifecycle transition
- markDeleted lifecycle transition
- updateContext changes context
- JSON round-trip serialization
- Service create stores draft
- Service save persists lifecycle
- Service restore returns restored lifecycle
- Service delete marks as deleted
- Service delete on missing returns false
- Service save on missing returns null
- Service restore on missing returns null
- No exact location required for creation (privacy contract enforced)

### Validation

All 14 Flutter tests pass (13 capture + 1 widget). All 4 validation Python scripts pass. pre_task_check.py reports 8 completed Sprint 0 tasks.

### Next Exact Action

# Task Log

## 2026-07-01: Planning System Initialization

### Status

In progress.

### Summary

Created the initial planning package for PakimonGO before implementation. Captured the purified product prompt, discovery notes, requirements, SRS, architecture direction, process rules, roadmap, repo structure, knowledge system, QA strategy, security/privacy plan, data model plan, scoring/economy plan, Agile backlog, risk/debt registers, and OKF-style knowledge summaries.

### Decisions Made

- Plan before coding.
- Use a strict phase order: Discovery, Requirements, Agile SRS, Architecture, Prototypes, Scaffold, Implementation.
- Treat Flutter as the proposed mobile platform pending prototype validation.
- Treat PostgreSQL/PostGIS/pgvector plus object storage as the proposed data direction.
- Treat Firebase Auth/App Check/Storage as useful platform services, not the only canonical database.
- Treat scoring as server-authoritative and evidence-based.
- Treat public map locations as privacy-safe aggregates, not exact pins.
- Treat UGC moderation as launch-blocking.

### Open Work

- Review and approve SRS direction.
- Create remaining ADRs.
- Validate map provider options with prototype/cost/legal review.
- Choose backend framework.
- Define scoring point ranges.
- Define first gold datasets.

### Next Exact Action

Review all planning docs for consistency, then create ADRs for auth, maps, AI scoring, storage, privacy, and moderation.

## 2026-07-01: Expanded Blueprint And Scaffold

### Status

In progress.

### Summary

Promoted the expanded PakimonGO blueprint into repository docs, repaired Git metadata, created the scaffold-only monorepo structure, added a short-burst commit policy, and added a conversation archive area for future full chat exports and AI handoff summaries.

### Decisions Made

- Treat the expanded 145-requirement catalogue as the active requirements baseline.
- Treat gated Alpha-0 as the active SRS posture.
- Preserve empty scaffold folders with `.gitkeep`.
- Require short-burst semantic commits with AI attribution trailers.
- Require conversation archive updates when prompts or responses change direction, requirements, architecture, risk, process, or implementation state.

### Open Work

- Review and accept/revise proposed ADRs.
- Begin first Alpha-0 vertical slice work package.
- Scaffold runnable Flutter/FastAPI toolchains after ADR readiness.
- Paste full visible conversation into the prepared raw archive file if desired.

### Next Exact Action

Review ADR-001 through ADR-016, then decide whether WP-015 starts with Flutter/FastAPI toolchain scaffold or OpenAPI/contracts.

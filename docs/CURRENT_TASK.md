# Current Task

## Active Phase

Phase 6: Feature implementation with auth, DB, API scaffolds, file storage, user profiles, duplicate/zoo precheck, AI adapter framework, async worker scoring, and map prototype.

Sprints 1-27 complete. 89 API tests all passing.

## Active Task

Pre-code preparation is complete enough. The active task is to begin Sprint 0 implementation using the existing packets, QA catalogue, and local validation guardrails.

## Current Inputs

- Android APK first; iOS later.
- 13+ launch posture.
- Full social target, gated by moderation/privacy/abuse readiness.
- Flutter mobile direction.
- FastAPI-style modular monolith direction.
- PostgreSQL/PostGIS/pgvector canonical state.
- Firebase Auth/App Check.
- Server-authoritative scoring.
- Privacy-safe map and no exact public animal pins.
- Small files, usually 200-300 lines.
- Persistent process, state, backlog, risk, debt, and conversation archive files.
- Short-burst semantic commits with AI attribution.
